The Allogen Compiler
====================

The Allogen compiler is a tool written in Java that parses IDL (Interface
Declaration Language) files and generates a set of output files in a given
target language.

The target language (see Target Languages for more information about supported
targets) is a programming language that Allogen will generate a wrapper
interface for native C++ code.
